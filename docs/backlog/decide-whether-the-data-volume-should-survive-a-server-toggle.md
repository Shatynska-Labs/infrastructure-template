Each stack couples its data volume to its server (`count = var.volume_enabled && var.server_enabled ? 1 : 0` in `terraform/stacks/*/main.tf`), so `server_enabled = false` discards the volume, which has no Hetzner backup. `add-prod-data-volume`'s design accepted this deliberately. The 2026-09-16 rehearsal showed the apply destroys the volume **first**, before the server. Decoupling would give the volume its own `location` and gate it on `volume_enabled` alone; the cost is not money but the toggle's meaning (`server_enabled` is "the way to stop paying for staging without deleting its configuration"), since a surviving volume makes "off" neither free nor clean.

It is not worth doing while *No Store on This Host Holds Data Requiring Backup* (`openspec/specs/iac-safety-hardening/spec.md`) holds: nothing on the volume is durable. **Must not undo**: when durable data lands on a host, decoupling and a real backup are owed together; decoupling alone looks like protection while protecting against nothing. The divergence that requirement records, `orders-ops`'s own PostgreSQL on production, which nothing backs up, is the first candidate to make the trigger real.

- **Kind**: It owes an `iac-safety-hardening`/stack delta and the operator's decision on the toggle's meaning, delivered with a backup.
- **Recorded by**: a question during `write-and-rehearse-the-rebuild-runbook`'s rehearsal (2026-09-16), once the destroy had shown what the coupling does; deliberately deferred as not yet worth doing.
